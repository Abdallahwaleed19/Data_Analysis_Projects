## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Testimonials not appearing**:
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure Font Awesome is loaded for icons
   - Check if localStorage is enabled

2. **Contact form not working**:
   - Check if EmailJS is properly configured
   - Verify Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Notifications not showing**:
   - Check if CSS is properly loaded
   - Ensure z-index is high enough
   - Check for JavaScript errors

### Browser Compatibility:
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Mobile browsers**: Full support

## Performance Notes

- Testimonials are limited to 10 to prevent performance issues
- localStorage is used for persistence (no server required)
- Notifications auto-cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Smooth animations are hardware-accelerated where possible

## Next Steps

1. **Set up EmailJS** for contact form functionality
2. **Test thoroughly** on different devices and browsers
3. **Customize** notification styles if desired
4. **Add analytics** to track form submissions (optional)

**Note**: The feedback system works completely offline and doesn't require any external services. Only the contact form requires EmailJS setup for email functionality.
